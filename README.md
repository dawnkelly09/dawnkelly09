- 👋 Hi, I’m @dawnkelly09
- 👀 I’m interested in transitioning from nursing to a career in web development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning beginning at the beginning with HTML, CSS, and soon JavaScript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on coding challenges that will stretch my abilities and help me show myself what I can accomplish.
